# 6. PRESS RELEASE

**Engage application increases engagement and eases lives of students and teachers.**

_Engage team has developed an application to streamline tedious applications._

COLLEGE PARK (NEWS WIRE). - October 30th, 2019. Today, Engage, a learning software company specializing in easing the lives of teachers/students and enhancing student engagement announces the reveal of their long awaited class tool. This tool will enhance the lives of not only teachers, but students as well. Tedious actions such as teachers sifting through endless emails finding the "hey sorry I missed class!" has been converted into a seamless task that saves countless hours. [INSERT TEAM NAME] has also streamlined requests made to the teacher such as asking for extensions, grade changes, and submitting excuse reports. 

According to one of Engage's lead developers, Esteban, "This application will enhance the daily lives of teachers and students tremendously. Administrative tasks that teachers reluctantly finish with skeptical accuracy and student's requests potentially being lost in a sea of the Professor's emails have been made astronomically simpler and easier to track. We look to make tasks like taking attendance in a 300 person classroom easy and seamless."

Leading up to this solution, surveys were taken in classrooms and data was collected to support the need for a product to enhance the lives of teachers and engage students more. Engage looks to make their big break and step in the learning software scene with a large impact.
