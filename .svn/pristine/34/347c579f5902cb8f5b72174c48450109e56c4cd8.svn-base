# Attendance Service

## Development
You must install docker to start this API. Additionally, the attendance service has a dependency on the course service (which is bundled in the docker-compose).

1. If using https, you must provide a .cert and .key in the certs folder. To generate self-signed certs, run: `openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert`
2. `docker-compose up`

API documentation can be found at the index endpoint. It is provided by Snowboard.
Note: to run the service in http mode, do not include the USE_HTTPS environment variable.
