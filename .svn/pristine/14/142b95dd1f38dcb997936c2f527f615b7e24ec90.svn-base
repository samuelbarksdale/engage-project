You must install docker to start this API. Additionally, the attendance service has a dependency on the course service (which is bundled in the docker-compose).

1. Change .env.example to .env and fill with the proper values to your environment.
2. `docker-compose up`

API documentation can be found at the index endpoint. It is provided by Snowboard.
