# Application Workflow and User Story

​	Here's Ed. **Ed is an Educator**. He's having some issues teaching students. He's too busy. There are too many menial administration tasks that need to be done, like marking attendance. What's more, his lectures are so large, he doesn't know who's who and what they're all thinking. Ed just wants to do what he loves, teach!

​	One of Ed's colleagues, Larry Herman, told him of a neat educational management system, called Engage. Ed is astonished, this is just what he needs. He navigates to the Engage website or downloads the mobile application, then **creates an Educator account**. 

​	The system prompts Ed to **create a class**. Ed decided to manage his classes next semester with Engage, so he create two classes. For each class, he **inputs start and end times, building locations, sections, capacity, and student rosters**. 

​	When Ed finishes setting up his class space, he sees them arranged on a dashboard. Clicking on one brings up a more detailed view of the class. Since the semester hasn't started yet, he doesn't see much activity, just some empty graphs.

​	The summer is at a close and the semester starts back up. Ed is ready and excited to test out Engage's educational management features. On the first day of class, Ed wants students to join his class, so he tells his **students to download the Engage mobile application**. Every registering student needs a class code, so next, he projects the **class code found in his administrator's class view**.

​	Here's Stu. **Stu is a Student**. She has a class with Educator Ed. Per his instructions, **she downloads the mobile application** on her Apple iPhone. She launches the application. A sign-in page connected to the University's CAS pops up. After signing in, the application prompts her to enter a class code. She enters the code Ed projected. Success! She's now registered for Ed's class. There is another bright, happy message telling her attendance has been checked. Good job, Stu! The next time she attends lecture, she won't have to even pull out her phone. **Engage will automatically detect when she arrives in the lecture hall and will report her attendance accordingly.** 

​	After data points start coming in, Ed can begin **viewing metrics graphically**. There are graphs **showing daily, weekly, and monthly attendance**. Ed can even **display metrics from just one class or just one student** if he wants. He can also **view attention metrics**, gauging for how long students are browsing their phones, or how many of them leave lecture early. 

​	Ed receives an email from Stu, the student. Stu is informing Ed that she has been absent due to an illness. Ed groans, managing absences are always painful. Thankfully, Engage has got him covered. **Ed remembers Engage has a built-in absence reporting system**. He forwards instructions to Stu.

​	Stu wants to mark her absent days and submit documentation so she can get her absences excused. She opens the mobile application and **selects the absence reporting tab**. **She notes the days she was gone, provides a rationale, and uploads the note her doctor gave her**. Now, she must wait for the educator.

​	Ed receives Stu's report, and **approves it**. **Engage will automatically update Stu's attendance record to adjust for her excused absences.** Then, if Ed uploaded a course schedule, Engage will inform both Ed and Stu of the material that Stu missed. That way, Stu can get caught up, and Ed doesn't have to cross-examine his schedule with her absences. 

​	Unfortunately, Stu begins to struggle in Ed's class. She starts browsing Instagram during lecture, leaves early, and sometimes never shows up. Luckily, Engage is looking out for her. The next time Ed opens the dashboard, the **app notifies him about Stu's difficulty engaging with the course**. From there, Ed can reach out and attempt to address some of her issues before it's too late. 

​	At the end of the semester, Ed is quite happy. He can view attendance and attention metrics and get a better sense of the coming and goings of his course. He also didn't have to spend time tracking down absence reports, it's all automatic. He even sent out **personalized after-hours notifications to at-risk students**. Did his personalized attention work? He can check attendance metrics of those students and find out. Ed is glad he chose Engage, but he hasn't even touched the **polling or survey features, which provide insight in student sentiment and comprehension**. No worries, just like every educator's teaching style, Engage is flexible. But, when Ed is ready to increase his *"LectureIQ"*, Engage will be waiting.
