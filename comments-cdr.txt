TEAM ENGAGE		77 / 100
Team members present:	all
Date/Time of CDR:     	0800 2019-11-22

This rubric is based on the assumption that we have come to strong agreement on the
shape and objectives of the project by means of our product definition exercise, aka
the "green light". That is the place where we established our expectations for this
project, and it is the necessary starting point for us to practice building according 
to a plan in a process-centered development environment. If planning was effective, 
then your implementation was straight forward. In any case, we assess how well this 
went in the present rubric. Later, part of the grade on your final delivery will be 
based on my assessment of how well the project captures the spirit of the original 
assignment, which is to say, I will assess how well you actually solved the problem.


MUNCHABLES      
scale:          At the morning demo after long night team hack, I see served ...
                 x no donuts.
                __ stale food service powdered sugar cake donuts.
                __ prepackaged food chain generic donuts.
                __ diverse assortment of glazed, frosted and jelly-filled Dunkin donuts.
                __ freshly made raspberry scones and blueberry muffins.
                __ Marathon Deli baklava.


FUNCTIONALITY   20/35
scale: 		I see nothing work
		I see some components ...
		... work partially, though with serious defects or system failures.
		... doing something even if we can't tell how related to problem.
    xx		... appear to address articulable parts of the spec, even if with rough edges.
		... smoothly address major parts of the problem (per spec), even if not all of it.
		... smoothly solve the problem (per spec), though with brittle edge cases.
		... smoothly solve the problem (per spec) using realistic data, showing the
                    product is ready for acceptance testing.


CONSISTENCY     15/15
scale:		System can't be demonstrated, is unrelated to the spec or project has no spec.
		System demonstrated exhibits substantial discrepancies from spec.
		System demonstrated exhibits minor (understandable) discrepancies.
		System demonstrated seems consistent with the spec.

				... hmm, after a fashion, I guess, so most points on functionaity.


IMPLEMENTATION  30/35
dimensions:	Configurations are actively managed and capture essential dependencies w/o bloat.
		Components support traceability to tests and spec.
		Reasonable code standards were employed and followed.
		Record evidences sustained development; the team was fully engaged and employed
			sound practices that improved quality based on experiences with system use. 
		Implementation decisions make effective use of resources and are efficient
			as appropriate to project.
		Implementation meets reasonable standards for security, privacy, accessibilty,
			usability and intellectual integrity (above and beyond requirements made 
			explicitly in the spec.)
		Code exhibits strong cohesion with low coupling between design units; dependencies
			are actively managed.

				... the 30 is about as generous as I can go based on some of
				... the code we pulled and looked over, and with looking at top
				... level at the config management.


PRESENTATION    12/15
scale: 		The team offered no presentation.
		In the team presentation I heard/saw ...
		... an ad hoc pitch that lacked organization and credibility.
		xxx a basic message though with need of polish (to timing,
			consistency, expression or similar)
		... a businesslike pitch/demo offered with professionalism and polish
